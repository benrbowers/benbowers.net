        <p>
            This library works by drawing circles on an HTML canvas element. Physics interactions like
            collisions, drag, and gravity are acheived by updating the state of each circle every frame
            of animation. I put together this little physics sandbox so you can get
            a good idea of what the library is capable of. Have fun!
